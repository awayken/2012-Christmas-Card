2012 Christmas Card
===================

2012 has been [one we'll always remember](http://www.milesrauschfamily.com/2012/). Our lives are never dull with Ian, but this year we added another character to our family cast: Ainsley Ann. The two of them make quite the pair. He dotes over her; she struggles to survive. We didn't stop with family updates, though. Both Holli and Miles changed jobs this year, ushering a whole heaping pile of new life experiences.

For our Christmas Card this year, we welcome you to play the game of life with us. Roll the die, draw a life card, and try to get your marker to the end of the board. Oh, and learn more about our 2012.
